# Introduction 
I have successfully implemented the API using Spring Boot. Makes use of H2 in-memory database. The database stores students objects which look like this. 
```javascript
 {
        "id": 5,
        "firstName": "Brenden",
        "lastName": "Murphy",
        "email": "BMurphy008@tcd.ie",
        "course": "Dentistry",
        "address": "987 Maximillia Gardens",
        "age": 20
 }
 ```

##  GET Requests

### GET /Students/

Returns an array of all the students in the database and `200 OK`. If database is empty, returns `204 No Content`.
For example
```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "firstName": "Cole",
        "lastName": "Cummerata",
        "email": "CCummerata827@tcd.ie",
        "course": "English",
        "address": "925 Jadon Freeway",
        "age": 22
    },
    .....

    }
]
```

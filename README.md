# Introduction 
I have successfully implemented the API using Spring Boot. Makes use of H2 in-memory database. The database stores students objects which look like this.

 {
        "id": 5,
        "firstName": "Brenden",
        "lastName": "Murphy",
        "email": "BMurphy008@tcd.ie",
        "course": "Dentistry",
        "address": "987 Maximillia Gardens",
        "age": 20
 }
